I am a Lecturer in Mathematical Sciences, specialising in nonlinear dynamics. 
I completed my undergraduate studies in Iraq before pursuing a PhD at the University of Exeter, UK, between June 2015 and December 2018.
Subsequently, I moved to [University College Cork (UCC)] (https://www.ucc.ie/en/matsci/) to work as a postdoctoral researcher between September 2019 and August 2023. 
I have been a lecturer at UCC since August 2023.

Research Interests
==================
My research interests lie in the theory and applications of nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory. For example:

* Tipping points in climate and ecosystems

* Dynamic games applied to cancer treatment

* Agent-based modeling and the stability of healthcare systems
