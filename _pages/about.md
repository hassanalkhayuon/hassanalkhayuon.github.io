I am a Lecturer in Mathematical Sciences specialising in nonlinear dynamics. 
I completed my undergraduate studies in Iraq and then pursued a PhD at the University of Exeter, UK, from June 2015 to December 2018. 
Afterward, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [University College Cork (UCC)](https://www.ucc.ie/en/matsci/) from September 2019 to August 2023. 
I have been a lecturer at UCC since August 2023.

Research Interests
==================
I am interested in the theory and applications of nonlinear dynamics. Some specific applications I am interested in:

* Tipping points in climate and ecosystems
* Dynamic games applied to cancer treatment
* Agent-based modelling and the stability of healthcare systems
